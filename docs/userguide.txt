=================================================

1. Starting the application
-------------------------------------------------
The application can be started with either no or exactly one command-line argument that specifies 
the application mode. The application is executed using a command of this exact form: 
	java -jar runme.jar <mode>
There are 3 possible modes of execution:
	-	java -jar runme.jar
			Starts the application in client mode
	-	java -jar runme.jar server
			Starts the application in server mode
	-	java -jar runme.jar alone
			Starts the application in stand-alone mode


2. Configuration
-------------------------------------------------
The application, irrespective of supplied mode of launch, will retrieve applicable properties from a 
file titled "suncertify.properties" in the current working directory. If the file does not exist at 
time of application start (i.e. launch via command line), then the user will be prompted to enter 
the required properties. Depending on mode of launch, different properties are required:
	-	Client Mode
			Server address and port
	-	Server Mode
			Absolute path of a database file and server port
	-	Stand-alone Mode
			Absolute path of a database file		
At this point, the user may choose to terminate the application by pressing the "Exit" button or 
proceed with entering in the requested configuration information. When the user confirms the 
configuration (i.e. pressing "Start" for example), the parameters are validated. If validation fails 
for any of the entered properties, an error message is  displayed and the dialog to edit the 
parameters will remain for the user to correct and retry entry. If validation succeeds, the 
properties are stored in the file titled "suncertify.properties" in the current working directory. 
It is not possible to change  the configuration, after the components (client/server/stand-alone) 
have been started. If configuration parameters need to be changed, the application must be 
terminated and restarted. On subsequent launches properties in the file will be loaded by default 
into the entry fields available on startup of the application. The following sub-chapters go through 
the properties in more detail for each of the launch modes.

2.1 Configuration in Server mode
In server mode, there are two configuration parameters:
- Database location
  	The absolute path and name of the data file to be used. The user can directly enter the 
  	parameter value in the text field. As an alternative, by pressing the "Browse..." button, a file 
  	chooser dialog opens that allows the user to select a data file. 	
- Server Port
  	The port on which the running server application will listen for client requests. The user 
  	enters a number between 0-65535. The number has a suggested value of 1099 if the configuration 
  	file does not exist.
  	
2.2 Configuration in Client mode
In client mode, there are two configuration parameters:
- Server Address
  	The hostname that corresponds to an IP address where the application is currently running in 
  	server mode. Alternatively the user can enter the IP address. The server address has a suggested 
  	value of localhost if the configuration file does not exist.
- Server Port
  	The port on which the running server application will listen for client requests. The user 
  	enters a number between 0-65535. The number has a suggested value of 1099 if the configuration 
  	file does not exist.

2.3 Configuration in Stand-alone mode
In stand-alone mode, there is a single configuration parameter:
- Database location
  	The absolute path and name of the data file to be used. The user can directly enter the 
  	parameter value in the text field. As an alternative, by pressing the "Browse..." button, a file 
  	chooser dialog opens that allows the user to select a data file.


3. Server mode
-------------------------------------------------
The server is started by choosing the "Start" button. When the server was successfully started an 
information panel in the server GUI will display the message "Server successfully started". All 
controls are now disabled in the Server GUI except for the "Exit" button, which if the user wishes 
to terminate the running server at any point, can be selected. 


4. Client and Stand-alone mode
-------------------------------------------------
Once the initial configuration dialog (in either client or stand-alone mode) has been completed, 
from the user's point of view, there is no difference in the way to invoke the application's use 
cases. The Bodgitt and Scarper CSR Booking System GUI presented is identical in both modes. The only 
difference is with regard to the actual operations being invoked either locally (stand-alone mode) 
or remotely (client mode). 

4.1 GUI Overview
The Bodgitt and Scarper CSR Booking System GUI layout is split into two distinct sections:
- Tabbed Panes
	There are two distinct tabs. The Search tab is to assist the user with finding matching 
	Subcontractors for a specified name and/or location. The Book tab is for reserving a 
	Subcontractor for a specified customer ID.
- Table
	The remainder of the GUI displays a table showing the Subcontractors in the database. If a user 
	has used the Search pane then the supplied search text will be used to filter the database and 
	the table will now display the results of the search.

4.2 Retrieving all Subcontractors
To retrieve all records a "Display All" button is available on the Search pane. Also if no text is 
supplied for the name and location field and the "Search" button is selected, then all records will 
be retrieved. The result is presented in the table. 

4.3 Searching for Subcontractors
When searching for a Subcontractor, a name and/or location can be used. Once the text is entered the 
Search is invoked by selecting the "Search" button. The result of the search operation is presented 
in the table. While the check box (to the left of the text "Exactly match Name and/or Location 
specified") is ticked the search operation returns all Subcontractors, where the specified search 
attributes exactly match the corresponding fields (including capitalization). Alternatively if the 
check box is not ticked then whole word text entry is not required (capitalization will be ignored 
also).

4.4 Booking a Subcontractor
The book tab allows the user to reserve a Subcontractor for a specified customer ID. To book a 
Subcontractor simply select a Subcontractor from the table displayed and enter a customer ID 
(8 digit number, for example 12345678) and select the "Book" button. To remove previously entered 
text in the customer ID text field, select the "Clear" button.

5. Trouble-Shooting
-------------------------------------------------
There are a number of error messages that may be displayed to the user based on either incorrect 
entry from the user or mandatory entry not being supplied when operating the different use cases in 
the GUI. The following sub chapters give a description of why these error messages are displayed.

5.1 The database location entered is not a valid file
An absolute path must be specified. The file must have a ".db" extension and must physically exist 
in the exact location as specified by the user.

5.2 Error in Port Number entry
The port number entered must be a numeric value between 0 and 65535 inclusive.

5.3 Server Address entered is not contactable
The server address can either be a machine name (such as "java.sun.com"), or a textual 
representation of its IP address. If a literal IP address is supplied, then it must be entered in a 
valid format (such as 156.151.59.19).

5.4 Please enter a valid Customer ID before attempting to book a Subcontractor
Before attempting to book a Subcontractor, a valid customer ID must be supplied. It should be in the 
format of an 8 digit number (such as 12345678).

5.5 There is currently no Subcontractor selected in the table
When attempting to book a Subcontractor, a selection must be made in the table listing of 
Subcontractors.

5.6 The selected Subcontractor is already booked
When attempting to book a Subcontractor who has already a valid customer ID in the "Owner" field. 
Please note the presented list of Subcontractors in a specific client may not reflect the most 
up-to-date status for all Subcontractors, and therefore when performing a booking task, what appears 
as an unreserved Subcontractor, may have been reserved by another client.

5.7 The selected Subcontractor information can not be found
When attempting to book a Subcontractor who has already been deleted by another client. Please note 
the presented list of Subcontractors in a specific client may not reflect the most up-to-date status 
for all Subcontractors, and therefore when performing a booking task, what appears as a valid 
Subcontractor, may have been deleted by another client.

5.8 Failed to connect to the Remote Server Application
When launching the application in network client mode (i.e. no command line parameters used during 
application launch), where no server instance is available to communicate with. This type of error 
is possible where the port number and server name (or IP address) have been validated as a 
contactable IP address but perhaps the server is not running on the server name/port combination 
entered. 

5.9	Communication issue encountered with remote server
Client and server had successfully worked but however there is now an issue with regard to the user 
selecting any of the use cases via the network client GUI where a response is expected from the 
server instance. The most likely reason for this type of error is probably because the server is no 
longer contactable. To protect the user from the scenario where the client is now out-of-date should 
(even if a new server instance be launched again0, this running network client will now exit and 
require a re-launch.
