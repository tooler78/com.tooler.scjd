1.	General

* As required, the DB interface has not been changed and is used exactly as
was intended with the assignment. However, it has been reformatted and its 
JavaDoc information has been completed to make it easier to use and to be 
consistent with all other classes/interfaces produced in this application 
implementation.

* In the delivered version of the implementation, all logging and testing
code has been removed to make the code clearer and more concise. As a choice
i decided that all issues/errors would be better served to the user in a UI
component (for example, an error message dialog). Although detailed logging
can be very helpful when an issue occurs, a user may not be aware of the 
logging file without prior reading of a User Guide. This can lead to frustration 
with regard to "What am i doing wrong" scenario. 

1.2 Package Structure

The following packages 
suncertify.application	
Provides the classes necessary for starting and handling shutdown of the application as well as service provider classes for interaction with our data objects.
suncertify.db	
Provides the DB interface and its local data file implementation along with all exception classes.
suncertify.db.lock	
Provides the classes for the application's locking mechanism.
suncertify.domain	
Provides the classes for the domain objects and database schema of the application.
suncertify.remote	
Provides classes to provide network connectivity between the client and the server using RMI.
suncertify.ui	
Provides all centralized GUI classes required by the UI components of either client or server launched application.
suncertify.ui.client	
Provides all client specific GUI classes required for this application to operate as either a networked client or a non-networked client.
suncertify.ui.server	
Provides all server specific GUI classes required for this application to operate as a server application.
